# WMATA_Project
This project is designed to explore patterns in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authorityâ€™s data to provide insight into transit behaviors. The project is broken down into three phases with each subsequent phase building off the previous stage(s). Each phase is designed to be vague to allow the data to provide insight into the direction of the project. Each phase will have an associated data visualization/dashboard to support the insights being derived from the data. The end goal of this project is to create a model that will predict late busses/trains and support commuters. Data will be stored in Snowflake warehouses. The phases are as follows:
1.	Import Bus Route and Stop Methods(1) and Train Positions(2) to examine the performance of the buses and trains. 
2.	Import Incidents(3) and weather data(Source TBD) to contextualize the transit performance and begin looking for associations in the data.
3.	Import local news(source TBD) to further contextualize the data and begin building out predictive models.
